# Surfs_up  Overview

The surfs up analysis used SQLAlchemy's ORM or object relational mapper function to create database created from analytics run on Oahu's weather to help show investors which locations in Oahu would be most ideal for building an ice cream surf shop on the island. Our priority was to create an app and then build our route. The next stage of the analysis used FLASK to share our analysis in a web framework with W. Avy's stakeholders to show Oahus previous years weather data to influence surf site selection.


##  Results

- June has a maximum temperature of 85 degrees and an average of almost 75 degrees during the summer.
- June has a higher degree of hotter days with temperatures averaging 77 degrees more than 75% of the month.

- December experiences an average temperature of 71 degrees which 4 degrees cooler than summer averages. December temperatures max is 83 degrees however during winter the temperatures will only exceed 74 degrees 25% of the month.

### Summary

The results show that besides the maximum high for June of 85 degrees and a maximum low of 56 degrees in December, the monthly average temperature for Oahu only ranges by 4 degrees.  The little amount of variance in temperature means that surf site selection should also incorporate other factors into their analysis such as pre.  W. Avy knows that precipitation means better surf, so we looked at Oahus precipitation values and plotted measurement scores. This helps give us better perspective when looking at overall annual weather trends. We can see that some months receive higher precipitation than others. Looking at our two queries below we can see that December has higher precipitation values with an average precipitation of .21 inches with maximum values of 6.42 inches. June has lower precipitation averages and max values.  This information can help W. Avy adjust his overall business model and decide which activities are more favorable based off of Oahu's monthly weather conditions. Selling ice cream during June with less rain and hotter conditions may be a more favorable business decision for Avy's surf shop.  Decemberâ€™s wetter and colder conditions means W. Avy should transition his business operations to focus primarily on surfing since these higher precipitation conditions are associated with higher period of swell.
