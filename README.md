# Surfs_up  Overview

The surfs up analysis used SQLAlchemy's ORM or object relational mapper function to create database created from analytics run on Oahu's weather to help show investors which locations in Oahu would be most ideal for building an ice cream surf shop on the island. Our priority was to create an app and then build our route. The next stage of the analysis used FLASK to share our analysis in a web framework with Avy's stakeholders to show Oahus previous years weather data to influence surf site selection.


##  Results

- June has a maximum temperature of 85 degrees and an average of almost 75 degrees during the summer.
- June has a higher degree of hotter days with temperatures averaging 77 degrees more than 75% of the month.

- December experiences an average temperature of 71 degrees which 4 degrees cooler than summer averages. December temperatures max is 83 degrees however during winter the temperatures will only exceed 74 degrees 25% of the month.

### Summary

The results show that besides the maximum high temperature for June of 85 degrees and a maximum low of 56 degrees in December, the monthly average temperatures for Oahu only ranges by 4 degrees.  The little amount of variance in temperature means that surf site selection should also incorporate other factors into their analysis such as pre.  Avy knows that precipitation means better surf so we looked at Oahus precipitation values and plotted measurement scores. This helps give us better perspective when looking at overall annual weather trends. We can see that some months recieve higher precipitation than others. Looking at our two queries below we can see that December has higher precipitation values with an average precipitation of .21 inches with maximum values of 6.42 inches. June has lower precipitation averages and max values which means that Avys business model needs to decide which part of his business is more important. Selling ice more cream during June with less rain may be more favorable or
