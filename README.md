# Surfs_up  Overview

The surfs_up analysis used SQLAlchemy's ORM or object relational mapper function to create database created from analytics run on Oahu's weather to help show investors which locations in Oahu would be most ideal for building an ice cream surf shop on the island.  Our first priority was to create an app and then build our route.  We used FLASK to share our analysis in a web framework with Avy's stakeholders to show Oahus previous years weather data.
